# Password-Generator---Module-5-Challenge

## Creation of an automatic password generator that will apply user choices.

My motivation for this project is to create a password generator that generates a unique secure password using the responses of the user. The user will be given the option of how long they would like the password to be, and if it should contain lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. 

I would like a system that creates a random password based on user answers to a selection of questions. This password will then be unique and very secure.

Having this system that automatically generates a random password between 8 - 128 characters will provide users with a secure option over creating an insecure password themselves. It gives the option of generating a new password for each account rather than reusing the same one.

During this project I was able to practice how to use Javascript functions, arrays and loops which used the information from each other to produce a random set of characters.
